Summary
-------

This is an example of developing Facebook appliactions in Opa. This app presents a `Sign-in with Facebook` button and upon clicking it, and authenticating with Facebook, presents the user with thumbnails of all her friends and their names. You can check its live version [here](http://facebook-01.tutorials.opalang.org).

This repository is the base for one of the 1h projects used during the [Opa DevCamp Night](http://parisopadevcamp.eventbrite.com) on 7th of March 2012 and led by [Adam Koprowski](http://adam-koprowski.net)

How to proceed
--------------

1. First open `01-battle-plan.md`, which presents the goal of the project and a small-steps plan on how to achieve it.

2. If at any point you get lost you can try `02-walk-through.md`, which offers a detailed article on developing this project.

3. If you get *really* lost you can peak into the `03-solution` directory. This is kinda like cheating. **Real code ninjas don't do that**.
